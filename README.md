# Readme

This repository contains a simple HTML document with an embedded SVG animation. The purpose of this code appears to be creating a webpage with a title "Fuckoff" and a hand SVG animation.

## Contents

- `index.html`: This is the main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage. It includes a canvas element with the class "webgl" and an SVG animation of a hand.

- `script.js`: This JavaScript file is imported using the `<script>` tag in the HTML file. It's likely to contain the script logic for handling the animation or any other interactive features on the webpage. Please check the content of the `script.js` file for more details.

## SVG Animation

The main visual element is an SVG animation depicting a hand. The hand SVG is defined with a path element and styled to appear in white. The animation might be manipulated by the JavaScript code.

## Running the Code

To view the webpage, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Ensure that all the files are in the same directory or update the paths accordingly.

## Additional Notes

- It's important to review the `script.js` file for any functionality related to the animation or interactivity.
